# Mastercard Phishing Simulation – Cybersecurity Awareness Project

This project was completed as part of the [Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-experience/vcKAB5yYAgvemepGQ/mastercard/cybersecurity-t8ye) on Forage. It simulates the process of executing a phishing campaign, analyzing results, and delivering targeted security training based on user behavior.

## Project Scope

Task 1: Create a Realistic Phishing Email  
- Designed a phishing email tailored to Mastercard employees.  
- Used a spoofed sender domain (supportlT@mastercard.co) to appear legitimate.  
- Incorporated urgency and internal compliance context to increase believability.  
- Included a masked hyperlink to encourage clicks.

Task 2: Analyze Simulation Results and Deliver Training  
- Reviewed open rate, click-through rate, and phishing success rate by department.  
- Identified Human Resources (75 percent success rate) and Marketing (38 percent success rate) as high-risk teams.  
- Developed a concise security awareness presentation (4 slides) targeted at these departments.  
- Training explained phishing tactics, detection tips, and prevention strategies in simple terms suitable for non-technical employees.

| IT            | 80%              | 2%                  | 0%                      |
| Engineering   | 70%              | 4%                  | 1%                      |
